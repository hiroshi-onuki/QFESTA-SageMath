# new FESTA

A proof-of-concept implementaion fo an improved FESTA by using a special endomorphism structure of the curve fixed as a system paramter.

Our code is partially baesd on 
[FESTA-SageMath](https://github.com/FESTA-PKE/FESTA-SageMath/tree/main).
In particular, we use the above code for computation of isogenies between PPAS and compression.
The following files are from FESTA-SageMath:
- compression.py
- divisor_arithmetic.py
- richelot_isogenies.py
- supersingular.py
- utilities.py
